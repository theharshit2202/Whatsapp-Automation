## Message: unknown error: msedgedriver only supports characters in the BMP


typically occurs when you're trying to send or process text containing emojis or special Unicode characters that are outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) using Microsoft Edge WebDriver (msedgedriver) in a Selenium or automation script.

üîç What is the BMP?
The BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) includes characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF. Emojis, musical symbols, and some other extended Unicode characters are outside the BMP, such as:

‚ú® (Sparkles)

üîπ (Small Blue Diamond)

These can cause issues with msedgedriver.


## Excel didnt support concatenate after certain length. #NAME eror occured

##  ChromeDriver only supports characters in the BMP   
Ah, this error occurs when trying to send messages containing characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in Unicode. This is a known limitation with ChromeDriver. Let's modify the message sending logic to handle these characters properly:

I've updated the message sending logic to handle non-BMP characters (like emojis and special characters) by:

1. Using JavaScript to set the text content directly, which bypasses ChromeDriver's character limitations
2. Adding a fallback mechanism that uses the original `send_keys` method if the JavaScript approach fails
3. Adding proper error handling and logging

The new approach:
1. First tries to send the message using JavaScript, which can handle any Unicode characters
2. If that fails, falls back to the original `send_keys` method
3. Maintains the multi-line message support
4. Adds small delays between operations to ensure stability

This should resolve the "ChromeDriver only supports characters in the BMP" error while maintaining all the functionality of your script.

Try running the script again with your messages. If you're still experiencing any issues, please let me know what specific error messages you're seeing, and I can help you troubleshoot further.

Also, make sure that:
1. Your Chrome browser is up to date
2. You're using the latest version of ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome version
3. Your messages don't contain any extremely large or complex Unicode characters

Would you like me to make any additional changes or help you with anything else?



## NO text was visible, just blank spaces
I understand the issue - the JavaScript method is causing the text to be invisible. Let's modify the approach to use a different method that will ensure the text is visible while still handling special characters:



I've made several important changes to fix the visibility issue:

1. Changed the primary message sending method to:
   - Use `innerHTML` instead of `textContent` for better text rendering
   - Add `focus()` to ensure the element is active
   - Use both JavaScript and `send_keys` for each line to ensure visibility
   - Added small delays between operations

2. Added a more robust fallback method that:
   - Sends text character by character
   - Has better error handling
   - Includes small delays between characters and lines
   - Continues even if some characters fail to send

3. Improved error handling and logging:
   - Added more detailed error messages
   - Added warnings for partial failures
   - Better exception handling at multiple levels

The new approach should:
1. Make all text visible in the message box
2. Handle special characters better
3. Be more reliable overall
4. Provide better feedback if something goes wrong

Try running the script again. The text should now be visible in the message box before sending. If you're still experiencing any issues, please let me know:
1. What specific characters or text are not showing up?
2. Are you seeing any error messages in the console?
3. Is the message box completely empty, or are some characters visible?

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the code?

## Now, it did sent the text, but the lines starting with emojis, that it didnt sent at all.
used ctrl c, ctrl v
